A super basic shim for the Notification api.

Makes chrome support the full api and adds a few simple extra methods, nothing too fancy (this is really just a shim). I may add FFOS support too but I haven't yet.

Read the code to find out more, there ain't much of it.

Currently only a browserify module really.
